# MCP Tools - Purpose and Architecture

## Purpose

MCP Tools provides a comprehensive suite of development workflow automation and analytics capabilities through a modular, container-first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture.

## Vision

Create a scalable, composable MCP ecosystem that separates development workflow tools from analytics/reporting capabilities while maintaining shared infrastructure and deployment flexibility.

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-MCP Server Design

MCP Tools implements a **split-domain architecture** with three specialized MCP servers:

```
ðŸŽ¯ Coordinator (Port 8002)
â”œâ”€â”€ Orchestrates and mounts other servers
â”œâ”€â”€ Main entry point for complete functionality
â””â”€â”€ Uses FastMCP composition patterns

ðŸ”§ Tools Server (Port 8003)                    ðŸ“Š Reports Server (Port 8004)
â”œâ”€â”€ Development workflow automation             â”œâ”€â”€ Team analytics and metrics
â”œâ”€â”€ PR health analysis                          â”œâ”€â”€ Quarterly performance reports
â”œâ”€â”€ Code quality reviews                        â”œâ”€â”€ Quarter-over-quarter analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ JIRA workflow transitions                   â”œâ”€â”€ Personal performance tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ Enhanced code review (role-based)          â”œâ”€â”€ Epic status reporting
â””â”€â”€ System utilities                            â””â”€â”€ Trend analysis with insights
```

### Domain Separation

| Domain | Focus | Tools | Audience |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Tools** | Development Workflow | PR analysis, code review, JIRA automation | Developers, DevOps |
| **Reports** | Analytics & Metrics | Team performance, trends, epic tracking | Managers, Team Leads |
| **Coordinator** | Composition & Orchestration | Mounts tools + reports servers | All users |

### Container-First Philosophy

- **Scalable**: Each server can scale independently based on demand
- **Modular**: Run individual servers or composed stack
- **Development Friendly**: Hot reload and isolated development environments
- **Production Ready**: Health checks, resource limits, restart policies
- **Flexible Deployment**: Docker Compose with dev/prod configurations

## Use Cases

### Development Workflow (Tools Server)
- **PR Health Analysis**: Comprehensive PR status with thread resolution
- **Code Quality Review**: Multi-role reviews (senior engineer, tech lead, security)
- **JIRA Automation**: Workflow transitions with intelligent path calculation
- **Enhanced Reviews**: Role-based analysis with team/service context

### Team Analytics (Reports Server)
- **Quarterly Reports**: Team performance with anonymized metrics
- **Trend Analysis**: Multi-quarter patterns and growth tracking
- **Personal Metrics**: Individual contributor performance analysis
- **Epic Tracking**: Comprehensive epic status with sub-task analysis

### Orchestration (Coordinator)
- **Unified Access**: Single entry point for all capabilities
- **Composition**: FastMCP mounting with clean prefixes
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across specialized servers

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: FastMCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Architecture**: Modular composition with shared common utilities

## Development Status

**Current**: Alpha development with active feature development
**Target**: Production-ready modular MCP ecosystem for development teams

## Key Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between workflow and analytics
2. **Scalability**: Independent scaling of different tool categories
3. **Flexibility**: Deploy what you need (tools-only, reports-only, or full stack)
4. **Maintainability**: Shared infrastructure with domain-specific implementations
5. **Team Focus**: Tools for developers, reports for managers, unified for leads
6. **Container Native**: Modern deployment patterns with development efficiency

## Future Roadmap

- **Enhanced Composition**: Additional specialized servers (notifications, integrations)
- **Service Mesh**: Inter-server communication patterns
- **Plugin Architecture**: Dynamic tool loading and registration
- **Multi-Tenant**: Team-specific configurations and data isolation
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and monitoring across all servers

This architecture positions MCP Tools as a foundational platform for development workflow automation while maintaining the flexibility to grow into a comprehensive development ecosystem.
