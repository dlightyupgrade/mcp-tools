## Review Thread Analysis
- Focus on open threads (not resolved, collapsed, or outdated)
- Categorize by urgency: blocking, important, suggestion
- Identify action items vs discussion threads

## Violation Classification
- **Blocking**: Merge conflicts, failed CI, security issues
- **High Priority**: Code quality violations, missing tests
- **Medium Priority**: Style issues, suggestions for improvement  
- **Low Priority**: Discussions, clarifications

## Output Format
```
Violation Summary:
- Open Threads: X (Y blocking, Z important)
- CI Failures: X failed checks
- Merge Status: [READY|CONFLICTS|BLOCKED]
- Action Items: Prioritized list with file:line references
```

## Quality Confidence Scoring
- **A+**: Comprehensive analysis with actionable solutions
- **A**: Solid analysis with clear next steps
- **B+**: Good analysis with minor gaps
- **B**: Adequate analysis, some areas need attention
- **C**: Basic analysis, significant improvements needed

## Comprehensive Assessment Areas

### 1. VIOLATIONS ANALYSIS
- Check for "DO NOT MERGE" labels or blocking issues
- Analyze CI status and test failures
- Review merge conflicts or branch protection issues
- Check PR approval status and review requirements

### 2. CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
- Review code changes for adherence to standards
- Check import organization and unused imports
- Verify patterns and code structure
- Assess error handling and validation patterns
- Review database query optimization
- Check for hardcoded values vs proper constants

### 3. TEST COVERAGE VERIFICATION
- Analyze test changes and new test coverage
- Check for proper test fixtures usage vs hardcoded values
- Verify unit tests focus on error scenarios
- Validate integration tests cover valid scenarios plus complex errors
- Review test naming and structure patterns

### 4. SECURITY REVIEW
- Check for exposed sensitive data in logs or errors
- Verify input validation and sanitization
- Review authentication/authorization changes
- Check for hardcoded secrets or credentials

### 5. BUSINESS LOGIC COMPLIANCE
- Verify adherence to business constants and patterns
- Check schema changes and synchronization
- Review service integration patterns and error codes
- Validate field naming conventions and type standards

## Assessment Criteria
- **APPROVE**: High quality, no blocking issues, meets requirements
- **REQUEST CHANGES**: Critical issues that block merge
- **COMMENT**: Quality suggestions but no blockers

## Review Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Structure
- Business spec linked and aligned
- Key stakeholders identified
- Epic/JIRA ticket referenced
- Clear objective and scope definition

### Phase 2: Repository Analysis
- Target project identified and accessed
- Current codebase state analyzed
- Planned changes verified against existing patterns

### Phase 3: Architecture Assessment
- Database changes: entities, migrations, relationships
- Domain model: services, DTOs, business logic
- API changes: GraphQL schema, resolvers, authorization
- Standards compliance: patterns, naming, error handling

### Phase 4: Complexity Evaluation
- Problem complexity: SIMPLE/MEDIUM/HIGH
- Solution complexity appropriateness
- Documentation needs: sequence diagrams, flows
- Error handling and edge cases coverage

### Phase 5: Service-to-Service Authorization
- @RunAsService annotation usage for all external service calls
- New service integration scope configuration in login-server
- Existing scope coverage verification for new operations
- Login-server application.properties updates required

### Phase 6: Security & Data Review
- PII data identification and encryption requirements
- Authorization checks and scope requirements
- Data access patterns and security compliance

### Phase 7: Reliability & Async
- TQF usage for async operations and replayability
- Idempotency key patterns and duplicate prevention
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Phase 8: Deployment Strategy
- Feature flags and gradual rollout planning
- Launch auditing vs long-term monitoring
- Rollback plans and risk mitigation

## Assessment Criteria
- **Grade A+/A**: Comprehensive, ready for implementation
- **Grade B+/B**: Good foundation, minor improvements needed
- **Grade C/D**: Significant gaps, major revisions required
- **Grade F**: Fundamental issues, complete rework needed
