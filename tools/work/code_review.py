        Comprehensive code quality review of pull requests - ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS ONLY.
        
        **Natural Language Triggers:**
        - "code review [PR_URL]"
        - "review this PR [PR_URL]" 
        - "analyze code quality in [PR_URL]"
        - "check code standards [PR_URL]"
        - "security review [PR_URL]"
        - "performance review [PR_URL]"
        - "review pr for [focus] [PR_URL]"
        
        **What this tool does:**
        Returns comprehensive instructions for analyzing code quality, security, performance, and 
        maintainability. Focuses on deep code analysis, standards compliance, and identifying 
        improvement opportunities. Does NOT execute review - provides detailed analysis framework.
        
        **Perfect for:** Code quality assessment, security audits, performance optimization, 
        standards compliance checking, mentoring feedback, pre-merge review.
        
        Args:
            pr_url: GitHub PR URL to review (e.g., https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123)
            focus: Optional focus area ("security", "performance", "tests", "maintainability")
            max_diff_lines: Maximum diff lines to analyze (default: 2000)
