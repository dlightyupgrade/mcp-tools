        Analyze PR health including open review threads, CI status, merge conflicts, and readiness - INSTRUCTIONS ONLY.

        - "check pr health for [PR_URL]"

        **What this tool does:**
        Provides comprehensive step-by-step instructions for analyzing PR health including open review 
        threads, CI status, merge conflicts, and overall readiness. Returns detailed GitHub API 
        commands for Claude Code to execute - does NOT run analysis directly.
        
        **Perfect for:** PR health assessment, code review cleanup, merge readiness evaluation, 
        identifying and resolving blocking issues.
